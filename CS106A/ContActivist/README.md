# ContActivist!

Download the eclipse project (including the web demo) [here](https://github.com/brahmcapoor/CS106-teaching-materials/raw/master/CS106A/ContActivist/download.zip)

## Summary

This is a program based on the section 9 handout of CS 106A Winter Quarter 2018 at Stanford University. The genuinely important things are as follows:

* `ContActivistClient.java`: a fully featured client
* `ContActivistServer.java`: a server that students need to implement
* `CongressMember.java`: a class representing a Congress Member that students need to implement.
* `ContActivistServerSoln.java`: solution code for the server (to be posted after I teach section)
* `CongressMemberSolution.java` solution code for the Congress Member class (to be posted after I teach section)

The `webpage` directory has resources for a web client to show students for fun. At this point, I can't think of anything else that might be important but this document will be updated as necessary. 

## How to use the web demo

1) Download the Eclipse project from this repo (see the link at the top of this document) and import it as you normally would.
2) Run `ContActivistServer.java` or `ContActivistServerSoln.java` from Eclipse, making sure that `private static final int PORT = 8000;`
3) Open `webpage/index.html` in your browser.
4) The demo should just work now. If anything weird comes up, shoot me an email at brahm@stanford.edu.
