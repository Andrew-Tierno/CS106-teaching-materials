        It's your first CS 106AP section! If you've section led before, sections
        this quarter are going to look largely like sections in previous
        versions of CS 106A and CS 106B. We'll be providing section handouts
        with several problems that you can work through with your section. In
        keeping with the pedagogy of lecture this quarter, some sections might
        have more lab-style problems than other sections, but in general, all of
        your previous training should still hold true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each week, you'll get a lesson plan like this one. This is mostly just
        suggestions as to what I think might make for an effective section. You
        should feel totally free to disregard this plan, though, if you have
        another idea. If you're super excited about an alternate lesson plan,
        feel free to post on the #spr19-ap-section Slack channel in case other
        people want to try it out!
      </p>
      <p>
        This week in section, we're hoping you can get to know your section and
        they get to know each other, and that they understand why section is
        such a cool and important part of 106AP. In addition, we have some image
        manipulation problems that you should work through with your section to
        reinforce their understanding of functions, decomposition and loops.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Getting to know your section & logistics</h2>
      <p>
        Feel free to spend a good chunk of time learning names, establishing how
        section works, and answering logistical questions about the class. Fun
        icebreakers are a plus. Make it clear that you and the rest of the
        course staff are here to support them in their learning over the course
        of 106A. Remind them that you are their primary point-person for
        questions about the class (although post on Slack or get in touch with
        Brahm if you ever aren't sure how to answer a particular question from a
        student!).
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a good idea to talk about IGs this quarter, explaining that they're
        a one-on-one time to talk about their assignments and about how the
        class is going generally. That said, later on this quarter, we might be
        rethinking the frequency of IGs since the assignments come pretty
        quickly. Thus, make sure they know to expect IGs for their first
        assignment, but don't make any particularly strong statements about what
        to expect after that.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this being said, if students go down rabbit holes of detailed
        logistical questions, feel free to have them come talk to you after
        section so that you leave at least ~20 minutes for Karel.

      <h2>Lecture Recap</h2>
      <p>
        As of your section, there will have been 5 or 6 lectures, and this
        section covers the first 5. Check out the slides for full details, but
        here's a quick summary of everything that went down. In addition, make
        sure to take a look at the exercises students went through in class.

          <p>
            We discussed what exactly the relationship between a programmer,
            code, and a computer is. One of the metaphors we used is that of a
            musician, the music they're playing, and the instrument they're
            playing on. In addition, we introduced the idea of a function as an
            atomic parcel of functionality. We talked about Bit, a Karel-like
            environment that students were introduced to basic programming
            principles on. Finally, we spent a little time reviewing syntax
            errors and bugs, and how to fix them.

            We introduced some of Bit's methods that return values (namely,
            <code>front_clear()</code> and <code>get_color()</code>) as an
            initial foray into variables. We used <code>front_clear()</code> as
            an introduction to boolean values as well as while loops and if
            statements, and <code>get_color()</code> as an introduction to
            storing more than just 2 possible values and <code>None</code> as
            Python's way of indicating the absence of something. Finally, we
            spent a little time talking about the memory model of variables,
            although we went into more detail on this in lecture #3.

          <p>
            After rounding off our discussion of variables and how they're
            stored in memory, we moved onto decomposition: specifically,
            defining our own functions with parameters and calling them. We
            discussed the two ways of calling functions, either as standalone
            functions or functions called on objects (although we didn't use the
            words 'object' or 'method' at any point). We then wrote a more
            complex program that used all of these ideas.

            At the time of printing, we haven't yet had these lectures. That
            said, the general plan moving forward will be to further discuss
            decomposition (i.e. return values and so on), introducing
            range-based
            <code>for</code> loops and finally introducing the
            <code>SimpleImage</code>
            interface, which we'll be using in section this week.
            <b>
              Students are not exposed to the idea of images being 2 dimensional
              arrays, but rather than they simply have coordinates so make sure
              to use this framing.

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>
        There are 2 problems in this week's section, both of which are intended
        to stretch student's newfound understanding of images, control flow and
        functions.
        <i>
          My suggestion is to focus on subproblems from the 1st problem, since
          they're a little heftier and the other problem lends itself better to
          individual work.
        </i>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Range-Loop Problems</b>
          <p>
            These problems are essentially image manipulation problems used to
            demonstrate basic structures in python programs. If you have time,
            do the first and last part of this problem. The first allows for
            students to gain familiarity with the canonical nested for loop used
            to process images, and the last with parameters and their usage. In
            addition, it might be worth discussing what students should be
            looking to understand from the other parts. For example, discussing
            generally how those solutions would differ from the first part would
            be an interesting conversation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Image Puzzles</b>
          <p>
            In lieu of trace problems on this handout, we have a collection of
            image puzzles in which students must perform color correction on an
            exaggerated image by modifying the color components of each of the
            pixels in the image. In order to do this, they must first look at
            the images and identify what's wrong with them. Color versions of
            the images are obviously not available on the black-and-white
            handout, but are on the online one, alongside a description of the
            issues for the color-blind and unbothered.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't feel like this is a particularly important one to do in
            section, especially given that it requires the use of a laptop. That
            said, you can have an interesting conversation about it. Whereas in
            the first problem in this section you needed to have a nested for
            loop to gain access to pixel coordinates, these problems require a
            single iteration over all the pixels in order to modify their
            components. Discussing when a nested for loop might be useful as
            opposed to a linear iteration would be useful for students.
