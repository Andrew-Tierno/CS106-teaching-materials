        Welcome to section for CS 106A! Each week, your section will meet to
        review the material from the course and to work through some problems.
        This week we'll work on image-loop problems, using material from the
        first few lectures. Problems like this will appear on this week's
        assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution code will be available for all section problems later on, so
        they will also serve as review problems. Each week's section page will
        list several problems, and your section leader will pick which problems
        to do and in what form.

        <h2> Image Range-Loop Problems </h2>
        <p class="hint">
          You might find nested <code>y</code>,<code>x</code> range loops
          helpful in solving these. Problems like this are well suited to making
          a drawing first to think through the algorithm before coding, and
          especially to get the arithmetic for each coordinate exactly right.
          These algorithms are a magnet for off-by-one errors.
        </p>
        <p class="hint">
          A good first step, as in lecture, is to sketch out the pixel grid
          <code>x</code>,<code>y</code> coordinates as in lecture to plan how
          your algorithm will access the pixels.

              <code>squeeze_width(filename, n)</code>: A funhouse mirror effect
              governed by the <code>int</code> parameter <code>n</code>. Create
              a new image with the same height as the original, but with a width
              that is <code>n</code> times smaller than the original's. Copy the
              original image such that it is squeezed horizontally.

              For example, if <code>n = 4</code>, the pixels in the output image
              with an <code>x</code> coordinate of <code>0</code> would be
              copies of the input pixels with an <code>x</code> coordinate of
              <code>0 * 4 = 0</code>, while pixels in the output image with an
              <code>x</code> coordinate of <code>1</code> would be copies of the
              input pixels with an <code>x</code> coordinate of
              <code>1 * 4 = 4</code>, and so on.

      <!-- Image Puzzle Problems-->
      <div class="problem">
        <h2> Image Puzzles </h2>
        <h5>
          This is a lab-style problem. You may want to work on this in groups on
          your laptop and test your programs as you write them.
        </h5>
        <p>
          Photo Editor programs are often used for color correcting digital
          images, that is, modifying the color components in images to alter the
          relative 'redness', 'greenness' or 'blueness' of the image. In this
          problem, we'll give you three exaggerated examples of images that need
          color correction-as well as what exactly is wrong with each of
          them-and you'll figure out how to alter each pixel in order to correct
          the image. For these problems, you should be able to use the plain
          'foreach' to solve each of them without needing to work with
          <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, implement the following functions, each of which takes
          in an image <code>filename</code> and returns a
          <code>SimpleImage</code>.
