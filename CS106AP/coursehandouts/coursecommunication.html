        We provide a variety of support resources in CS106A to help you as much
        as possible with assignment, material, or other questions throughout the
        quarter. These include: your assigned Section Leader, the LaIR, the
        CLaIR,
        <a href="http://piazza.com/stanford/spring2019/cs106ap" target="_blank"
          >Piazza</a
        >, and weekly office hours held by Nick and Brahm. To help you make the
        most of these resources, we've compiled a list of common issues or
        questions that may come up throughout the quarter, and the best way to
        get help for each.

        <b style="color:blue">conceptual question</b> about the course material:
      </h3>

      <p>
        We love conceptual questions. Conceptual questions are the height of all
        course queries. It often takes more work to figure out what concept you
        are confused about, but if you do that extra work, you will learn much
        more in return. You can ask conceptual questions to any course staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Go to the LaIR, stop by any office hours, email your Section Leader or
          post on Piazza!
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the LaIR there is a special sign up for conceptual help called the
        CLaIR, or "Conceptual LaIR." This is a higher priority queue and you
        will get a faster response. When getting CLaIR help, section leaders
        won't look at your code but instead teach you the concepts you need for
        your homework. Understand concepts before you code! It will make life
        much more pleasant.

      <h3>

        <b style="color:blue">a bug</b> in my code, or another question about my
        code:
      </h3>
      <p>
        We all get stuck when programming. There are times when the best thing
        to do is to work through the bug yourself -- learning by doing is
        powerful. However, there are also times when an experienced programmer
        can help get you on the right track. Course staff will help you learn
        how to narrow down what may be going wrong in your code and how to
        approach fixing it.

      <p>
        It turns out that code is terribly difficult to debug over email or over
        Piazza so please come in person, if possible.

        penalty-free late days for each assignment.

      <p>
        Anyone on the course staff would appreciate a good conversation about
        where this crazy world is headed. If you are interested in more specific
        career advice, ideas on how to restrategize your learning, or just want
        to talk about life at Stanford, please feel free to come to Nick or
        Brahm's office hours.

          Talk to Nick or Brahm!

      </p>

      <p>
        We have no expectations for students who come to office hours - it's
        totally fine to just come with a general sense of confusion or the
        desire to work and ask us questions whenever you need to.
