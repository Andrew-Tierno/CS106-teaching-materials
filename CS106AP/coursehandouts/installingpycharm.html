          So far in CS 106A, you've been programming in Python on your browser.
          Moving forwards, however, you will be writing your code on your
          computer using an application called
          <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"> PyCharm</a>. PyCharm is
          what is known as an IDE, or <i>Integrated Development Environment</i>,
          which means that it allows us to edit our code, browse our files, run
          our programs and debug them, all in the same place. It's one of the
          most popular Python IDEs in the world, and used extremely commonly in
          industry. This handout is intended to take you through installing
          PyCharm on your own computer.

        <h2>Setting up</h2>
        <h4>The Terminal</h4>
        <p>
          The Terminal, also sometimes called the <i>Command Line</i> or the
          <i>Command Prompt</i> on Windows, is a text-based interface for
          operating your computer. We'll be using it a bit throughout the
          quarter in order to run our programs, so make sure you know how to
          open the Terminal on your computer.
          <a
            href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            This website
          </a>
          explains how to find the Terminal application on your computer, as
          well as some further details on what you can do with it. You don't
          need to worry too much about those details just yet, although you're
          free to peruse them if you'd like. As we go through the quarter, we'll
          explore the capabilities of the terminal in much greater depth.

        <h4>Installing Python</h4>
        <p>
          In order to be able to run Python programs on your computer, you need
          to install a <i>Python Interpreter.</i> An interpreter is a program
          that is capable of reading a <code>.py</code> file that you have
          written, and translating the Python code in that file to instructions
          that your computer can easily execute. Begin by downloading Python:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-macosx10.9.pkg"
            >
              Mac Installer
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-amd64.exe"
            >
              Windows 64-bit installer
            </a>
            (If you're using a relatively new Windows computer, download this
            file)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3.exe">
              Windows 32-bit installer
            </a>
            (If you're using an older Windows computer, download this file)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Installing on a Mac</b>
        <p class="note">
          <b>Note: </b> Macs come with a version of Python installed, but this
          is an older version of Python (specifically, Python 2). CS 106A
          requires the use of Python 3, so make sure to follow these
          instructions even if you think you already have Python installed. If
          you require the use of Python 2 for other work, you can still install
          Python 3, which exists alongside Python 2 rather than replacing it.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open the downloaded Python installer file and follow the default
            instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open up your terminal application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type <code>python3</code> and press enter. You should see something
            that looks like this:

        <h3> Installing and Testing PyCharm </h3>
        <h4> Installation </h4>
        <p>
          To get started, download and install the community version of PyCharm:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac">
              Mac Download
            </a>
            (Open the downloaded <code>.dmg</code> file and drag PyCharm into
            your Applications folder)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows"
            >
              Windows Download
            </a>
            (Open the downloaded <code>.exe</code> file and install PyCharm,
            using all the default options. )
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Testing PyCharm </h4>
        <p>
          Now that you have PyCharm downloaded and installed, open it up and
          follow the setup wizard, which allows you to choose some default
          settings. Feel free to install any additional plugins it suggests,
          although none will be necessary for this class.
        </p>
        <p>
          PyCharm models a program as a 'project', which consists of one or more
          Python files, as well as any additional resources like images or text
          files. To get you familiar with working with projects in PyCharm,
          we've provided a sample project, which you can download
          <a
            href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106ap/handouts/pycharm_intro.zip"
          >
            here</a
          >. To test out this project, and to gain familiarity with the PyCharm
          environment, download the sample project and open it in PyCharm (using
          the 'open' option on the first screen). Now, follow the steps below to
          run the project in PyCharm:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, you need to <i>configure the interpreter</i> for the project,
            which essentially means that you want to specify the version of
            Python you'll be using to run your code. To do so, click 'configure
            Python Interpreter' at the top of your window:
          </li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <img
                src="pycharm_images/mainwindow.png"
                class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <li>
            Then, select the dropdown at the top of the window and click 'show
            all'.
          </li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <img
                src="pycharm_images/dropdown.png"
                class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <li>
            Then click the + button at the bottom left corner.
          </li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <img
                src="pycharm_images/add_interpreter.png"
                class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <li>
            Now, Python 3.7 should automatically be selected on the next window.
            Click 'OK', and save your progress. PyCharm might take a while to
            recognize your interpreter, but you should eventually be good to go.
          </li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <img
                src="pycharm_images/interpreterchoice.png"
                class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <li>
            Once PyCharm has finished recognizing your interpreter (indicated by
            the progress bar in the bottom right corner), you should be ready to
            run your program! Click the green arrow in the top right of the
            window to run, and you should see your program's output in the
            bottom pane.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you get an error saying "cannot run program", click "intro" in
              the top right>edit configuration>python interpreter> Python 3.7.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <img
                src="pycharm_images/first_run.png"
                class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <li>
            Now, click 'terminal' in the bottom of your Window to open up
            PyCharm's integrated terminal. Type
            <code>python3 intro.py &lt;YOUR NAME HERE&gt;</code> (or on Windows,
            <code>py intro.py &lt;YOUR NAME HERE&gt;</code>) and press enter to
            see the program's output. Congratulations! You've successfully set
            up PyCharm!
